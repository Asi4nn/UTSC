# Year 1 (Fall 2019 - Winter 2020)

## CSCA08
with Anya Tafliovich

### Difficulty: 1

Baby's first cs course, was mostly stuff I learned in high school, all done in python. Pretty useful as it is the basis of programming experience.

## MATA31
with Natalia Breuss

### Difficulty: 3
### Usefulness: 3
### Enjoyment: 4

Mostly calculus learned from high school, but with many proofs (esp delta epsilon). Memorizing how some proofs go aren't all that useful but in general you will need this content for later. Solving HW problems are pretty enjoyable for me.

## CSCA67
with Anna Bretscher

Arguably the hardest 1st year course, since it introduces formalized proofs for the first time to most. Takes quite a lot of practice to get the hang of it all, but it is the basis of many courses to come. Many problems are still pretty satisfying to solve.

### Overall A tier course

## CSCA48
with Paco (Francisco Estrada)

### Difficulty: 4
### Usefulness: 5
### Enjoyment: 3

Introduction to a broad scope of important CS topics like complexity, memory, linked lists, recursion, etc. All done in C, which is pretty unforgiving to code in. mostly difficult because of Paco's insane quizzes and tests.

### Overall B tier course

## MATA22
with Kaidi Ye

### Difficulty: 2
### Usefulness: 3
### Enjoyment: 3

Lots of concepts and proofs from linear algebra, some from high school, a lot a new content. Also fairly important for upcoming courses depending on your choice of electives. Proofs pretty interesting, explanations could've been better tbh. Go to the review seminars if you want good test marks.

## MATA37
with Kathleen Smith

### Difficulty: 4
### Usefulness: 4
### Enjoyment: 5

Kathleen hands down the best prof I've had for any math course. Content is pretty heavy with the introduction of integrals, series, etc, but the HW will give you all the understanding you need.

### Overall S tier course

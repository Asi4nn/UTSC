# Year 3 (Fall 2022 - Winter 2022)

## CSCC63
with Nick Cheng

### Difficulty: 5
### Usefulness: 2
### Enjoyment: 2

Uses CSCB36 knowledge to apply to computability and complexity of problems in general. First half (computability) is much easier than second half (complexity), and Nick's assignment + test questions are absolutely brutal. Definitely a monster course, and not really all that applicable out of research either, despite what Nick may tell you.

## CSCC37
with Richard Pancer

### Difficulty: 3
### Usefulness: 1
### Enjoyment: 1

Def one of the least enjoyable math-based courses I've ever taken. A lot of ambiguity, lectures are zzzzz, tutorials are zzzzz, Pancer doesn't use piazza or quercus and responds to 50% of the emails about the egregiously ill-defined assignments. Luckily he 100% reuses questions to past exams so just do all of those to get decent marks. Second half of the course is definitely a bit better than the first. Also generally not applicable to the vast majority of software jobs.

## CSCD27

### Difficulty: 3

Computer Security is a complicated opinion, I really do think the content is great and they cover really important and useful things which apply to real situations, but I gotta say that some content and labs just fall flat in terms of any learning substance. Not to mention that the course administration was kinda messy and sometimes requirements were not laid out clearly.

I can't post any of the labs and HW for this one, but do note that the weekly labs + hw WILL eat a lot of your time. A lot of it is self learning through documentation and understanding the requirements.

## CSCC43
with Purva Gawde & Rawad Abou Assi

### Difficulty: 2
### Usefulness: 4
### Enjoyment: 2

Not much to say about databases, it's obviously pretty useful stuff, mostly the sql part, tho pretty boring imo. Not really sure if relational algebra or normal forms will ever come in use. Purva does group assignments, usually kinda scuffed but should be fine if you do it early and check for errors on piazza.

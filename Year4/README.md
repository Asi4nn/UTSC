The course isn't so much about UI design as many will think, it's more about the design process. Most of the mark is the group project which you need to design and evaluate a UI. Not much else to say, content is boring to me, but evaluations are very easy.

I can't post our project because of the rules, but anything you hear about this course being one of the hardest is absolutely true. The majority of your marks come from 4 projects regarding PintOS. These projects are some of the hardest to debug programs I have ever had the displeasure of working on. Thankfully the exam is easy.

This course was a refreshing break from all the CS courses, and really puts forward many interesting ideas that tech people don't usually consider. Ideas like building technology to serve democracy and the consequences of using machine learning algorithms to automate decisions are just a few topics in this ethics course. I would 100% recommend this course to anyone entering the tech field, only real downside is the amount of time it takes to research and write the term paper + assignments.

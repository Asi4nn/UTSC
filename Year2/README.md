# Year 2 (Fall 2020 - Summer 2021)

## CSC207
with Lindsey Shorser

### Difficulty: 3
### Usefulness: 4
### Enjoyment: 1

UTSG version of CSCB07. Intro to design principles, including OOP and OOD, done in Java. Includes final group project. Tests are pretty easy, I don't like Java, but the pricinples are fairly important for actual applications, though I learned it in grade 12.

## MATB24
with Camelia Karimianpour

### Difficulty: 4
### Usefulness: 3
### Enjoyment: 3

Follow up to lin alg 1, and it is much heavier than last time. Concepts become more abstract, and questions become more wild. Though it was fun to solve some questions, many were just way to hard.

## CSCB36
with Nick Cheng

### Difficulty: 4
### Usefulness: 2
### Enjoyment: 2

The application of discrete math (mainly induction) to computation related things like automata and languages. Some concepts are definitely harder to understand than others, but Nick especially gives insane questions sometimes. You will need to remember a fair bit of this material for CSCB63.

## MATB41
with Xiao

### Difficulty: 4
### Usefulness: 3
### Enjoyment: 1

Follow up to MATA37, and we doing it in 3D now! Though the content seems like something I would enjoy, the teaching style of Xiao was just not it. A lot of concepts are just black boxes and are not explained at all. An exam average of 20% pretty much says it all, but is likely useful in things like computer graphics, ML, and the like.

## STAB52
with Leonard Wong and Sotirios Damouras

### Difficulty: 5
### Usefulness: 3
### Enjoyment: 3

A LOT of content regarding probability theory, and some of it requires MATB41 knowledge (which is not a prerequisite). Some stuff is hard to understand since it's based on measure theory (which is not taught), and there is an absurd amount of content.

## CSCB20
with Purva Gawde

### Difficulty: 1
### Usefulness: 4
### Enjoyment: 3

Easy intro to web dev and databases, not meant for cs students but you can take it anyways. You can Google a lot of the answers you need for assignments, and there is optional group projects. Funny enough this content is actually really useful before taking CSCC01.

### Overall S tier course

## CSCB09
with Bianca Schroeder

### Difficulty: 3
### Usefulness: 4
### Enjoyment: 3

Intro to linux and all things file-like. This course is also in C so you better remember your CSCA48. You learn a lot about shell and file descriptors, and it's all done in linux. Tests were alright, assignments were mostly fine.

## CSCB58
with Rabia Bakhteri

### Difficulty: 3
### Usefulness: 3
### Enjoyment: 3

Assembly and circuits. You basically start at the very building blocks of a CPU and go up to assembly (logic gates, flip-flops, adders, etc.) There were simulated circuit labs and a final project making a game in assembly, I'll tell you that is really not fun to code. Most of this stuff is only sometime useful to specific fields of CS.

## CSCB63
with Purva Gawde

### Difficulty: 4
### Usefulness: 5
### Enjoyment: 3

First comprehensive intro to data structures and algorithms that apply to them. You also do time + space complexity analysis. This stuff is extremely useful for interviews and just for your coding knowledge in general, but there is quite a lot of it. Though I feel like Purva did't teach it as well as, say Anya, would.

## CSCC01
with Ilir Dema

### Difficulty: 3
### Usefulness: 5
### Enjoyment: 4

Group project web application, we used React, Django, and MongoDB, but you can literally pick anything. Pretty fun stuff if you do it with a group that cares and works on the project. and is obviously very useful (got me an internship basically). Ilir's lectures can pretty much be learned through the slides, tho not the most useful info, and the assignments are a giant pain. There is only one test during midterms, no final.

### Overall A tier course if you have a good group

A:
GUI design, creation and connection to the backend of the program, and debugging message system and GUI.

B:

C:
Quick responsive times to fix bugs that were found in relating systems
Good coordination to get meetings to discuss critical design decisions

D:
Clear instructions laid for design, as I designed a lot of the GUI, what it looks like is heavily dependant on what the program wants to do

E:
Quick learner, so I could pick up JavaFX and start creating the GUI quickly
Team leadership: Took charge and laid clear designs for the GUI for the others to follow

F:
Devote more time to getting to know teammates, free more time to work on the project overall (there were some features we wanted that we didn't have time to add)


Sidenote:
I realized I didn't hand in a Reflection1, I remembered that I thought they were just things to talk about in the TA meeting, I did discuss all the content of those questions in Reflection1 with the TA that week, is it possible to get that assignment waived?
